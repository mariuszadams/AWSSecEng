Security is one of the main concerns in cloud adoption. An increase in cyber-attacks and data privacy leaks remain top of mind for most industry personnel. Security Engineering on AWS addresses these concerns and more by helping AWS Cloud professionals better understand how to interact with AWS. This is accomplished by creating secure identities and roles, managing and provisioning accounts, and addressing Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. In this course, you will get an understanding of how to monitor and protect data with encryption and how to use secrets management using key AWS services, such as AWS Key Management Services and Cloud Hardware Security Module. You will learn how to monitor, generate, and collect incident logs, and how to identify, investigate, and mitigate security incidents with AWS Services.
